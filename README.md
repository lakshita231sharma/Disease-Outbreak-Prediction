Overview
This project presents a Bayesian SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) modeling framework using COVID-19 case data for multiple countries, enabling the forecasting of disease outbreaks and intervention scenario analysis. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook with PyMC for Bayesian inference and rich visualizations of model fits and projections. The methods can be adapted for other infectious diseases by substituting the input data.

Features
Automated data loading, preprocessing, and aggregation from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dataset.

Fitting of a multi-country SIR model using probabilistic programming and informative priors.

Log-transform stabilization to handle overdispersed case time series.

Posterior analysis and prediction intervals for case forecasts.

Intervention scenario analysis by modifying SIR parameters (e.g., effect of reducing the transmission rate).

Interactive forecasting dashboard and summary visualization for real-time monitoring and uncertainty assessment.

Model parameter and risk level reporting for all countries analyzed.

Requirements
Python 3.10+

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Major Libraries:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scipy (=1.10.1)

aesara

pymc

arviz

scikit-learn

Note: Dependency conflicts may arise if incompatible versions are already installed (especially numpy/scipy/pandas); review pip output and adjust as needed.

Installation
Install all required libraries via pip:

text
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy==1.10.1 aesara pymc arviz scikit-learn
If using Colab or Jupyter, add these cells at the top of your notebook to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

Data
Data Source: The notebook reads global COVID-19 case data from the [Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 Github repository].

Aggregates time series case data by country, drops coordinates, and log-transforms daily increments to handle variance/stabilization.

Focus countries include: US, India, Brazil, Russia, and the United Kingdom (modifiable in the notebook).

Usage
Clone or download the notebook and open it in Jupyter or Colab.

Ensure all dependencies are installed (see above).

Run all cells in sequence:

Data will be loaded and preprocessed automatically.

The SIR model is built and fit via PyMC for all listed countries.

Posterior predictions, intervention scenarios, and dashboards are all generated and visualized in the cells.

Adjust parameters or selected countries as desired for custom analyses.

Modeling Approach
The Bayesian SIR model is constructed for each country with priors informed by epidemiological literature.

Fitting is carried out using MCMC sampling in PyMC to estimate transmission and recovery rates, and initial infections.

Posterior predictive sampling gives credible intervals for future cases, using log transformation for consistent scaling.

The dashboard summarizes fit quality, model parameters (including

 ), scenario forecasts, and real-time risk, with plots and tabular reports.

RMSE and MAE are provided for validation against observed data for quantitative assessment.

Intervention Scenarios
The code allows modeling interventions by reducing the transmission rate after a defined number of days (default: 50% reduction after 10 days).

Intervention effect is visualized compared to actual historic data and regular model forecasts, enabling what-if analysis for containment strategies.

Results
Plots include historical/forecasted cases, 95% posterior credible intervals, parameter distributions, and risk dashboards.
